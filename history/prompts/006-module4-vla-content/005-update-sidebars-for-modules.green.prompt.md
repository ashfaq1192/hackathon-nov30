## Prompt

I have generated content for all 4 Modules (Module 1, 2, 3, and 4), but they are not showing up in the sidebar. Please READ 'book-app/sidebars.ts' and REWRITE it to include: 1. A category 'Module 1: Robotic Nervous System' (autogenerated from 'docs/module-1'). 2. A category 'Module 2: Digital Twin' (autogenerated from 'docs/module-2'). 3. A category 'Module 3: AI-Robot Brain' (autogenerated from 'docs/module-3'). 4. A category 'Module 4: Vision-Language-Action' (autogenerated from 'docs/module-4'). Make sure the sidebar is structured so all these appear under the main 'Tutorial' sidebar.

## Response snapshot

I have updated book-app/sidebars.ts to include the categories for Module 1, 2, 3, and 4 under the main 'Tutorial' sidebar.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully updated the Docusaurus sidebar configuration to include new module categories.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: book-app/sidebars.ts updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual PHR creation. Ensure script path is correct or agent-native flow is robust.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found. This required manual creation of the PHR.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Verify the path to `create-phr.sh` and ensure it's executable, or refine the agent-native PHR creation process.

## Prompt

The frontend build is failing with a ValidationError: '"label" is not allowed'. This is happening in 'book-app/sidebars.ts' because `autogenerated` items cannot have a `label` property directly. Please READ 'book-app/sidebars.ts' and REWRITE it to fix the structure. Wrap each module in a 'category' type object like this: { type: 'category', label: 'Module 1: Robotic Nervous System', items: [ { type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'module-1', }, ], } Do this for all 4 modules (Module 1, 2, 3, and 4).

## Response snapshot

I have restructured book-app/sidebars.ts to wrap each autogenerated module within a 'category' object. This should resolve the ValidationError.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully fixed the ValidationError in `book-app/sidebars.ts` by restructuring the sidebar configuration.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: book-app/sidebars.ts updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual PHR creation. The `label` property was incorrectly applied to `autogenerated` types, which was fixed by wrapping them in `category` objects.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found. This required manual creation of the PHR.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Verify the path to `create-phr.sh` and ensure it's executable, or refine the agent-native PHR creation process.

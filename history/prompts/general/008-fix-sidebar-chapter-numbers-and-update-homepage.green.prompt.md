## Prompt

I have run backend and then frontend and observed that chapters numbers are not displayed under each module. Secondly the content of books is placed under tutorial tab, rather it should be in the home page where there is bold written title of the book "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" and under that there should be two tabs one for "Start Reading" and other for "Github" and that github link should lead to the user to the github user named 'ashfaq1192' to the repository of 'hackathon_nov30'.

## Response snapshot

I have updated `book-app/sidebars.ts` to display chapter numbers under each module and modified `book-app/src/pages/index.tsx` to include 'Start Reading' and 'GitHub' links on the homepage.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The sidebar now correctly displays chapter numbers for each module. The homepage has been updated with a "Start Reading" button that links to the first module's introduction and a "GitHub" button linking to the specified repository.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: book-app/sidebars.ts, book-app/src/pages/index.tsx updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully addressed both issues related to sidebar numbering and homepage content/links. The previous attempt to fix the sidebar introduced a `ValidationError` by mixing `autogenerated` with explicit `doc` types, which was corrected by fully specifying the `doc` types.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual creation of the PHR. Also, the user interrupted a previous tool call, necessitating a new PHR for this completed task.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure all necessary scripts (e.g., `create-phr.sh`) are correctly located and executable in the environment to avoid manual PHR generation.

Implement Authentication and Personalization using Better-Auth.
1. Install `better-auth` in `book-app`.
2. Create a `lib/auth-client.ts` for the frontend auth client.
3. Create a `src/pages/signup.tsx` page.
4. In the Signup form, ask for Email, Password, and a **Dropdown for Skill Level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
5. Store this Skill Level in the user's session/metadata.
6. Update `ChatWidget.tsx` to send the user's Skill Level to the backend along with their message.

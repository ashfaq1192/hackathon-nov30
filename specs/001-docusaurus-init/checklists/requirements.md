**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-29
**Feature**: [Link to specs/001-docusaurus-init/spec.md]

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 Are there any implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) mentioned in the spec? [Clarity]
- [x] CHK002 Is the spec focused on user value and business needs? [Clarity]
- [x] CHK003 Is the spec written for non-technical stakeholders? [Clarity]
- [x] CHK004 Are all mandatory sections completed? [Completeness]

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 Are all requirements testable and unambiguous? [Clarity]
- [x] CHK006 Are all success criteria measurable? [Measurability]
- [x] CHK007 Are all success criteria technology-agnostic (no implementation details)? [Clarity]
- [x] CHK008 Are all acceptance scenarios defined for each user story? [Completeness]
- [x] CHK009 Are edge cases identified and described? [Coverage]
- [x] CHK010 Is the scope clearly bounded? [Completeness]
- [x] CHK011 Are dependencies and assumptions identified? [Completeness]

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK012 Do all functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria? [Completeness]
- [x] CHK013 Do user scenarios cover primary flows? [Coverage]
- [x] CHK014 Does the feature meet measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria? [Measurability]
- [x] CHK015 Are there any implementation details leaking into the specification? [Clarity]

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`

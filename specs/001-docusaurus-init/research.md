## Clarification of Performance Goals

### Decision Needed: Quantify Performance Goals for Docusaurus Site

**Context**: The Technical Context in `plan.md` currently states "Responsive page loads for the Docusaurus site. (NEEDS CLARIFICATION for specific metrics)". Specific, measurable performance goals are required for clear success criteria and future optimization efforts.

**What we need to know**: What are the specific performance metrics and targets for page load times on the Docusaurus site?
